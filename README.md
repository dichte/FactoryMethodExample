# Problem Statement  
Given we have a program that display loan products, we want to enhance and improve on this program by adding more products but with the current structure, it would become maintenance nightmare as we follow the pattern by adding new product class each time. Code duplication would be serious matter in long run.  

# Exercise  
Refactor this program by using `Factory Method` pattern so it can add layer of abstraction and achieve SOLID principle.

#### **Time:** _30 minutes_  

#### **Expected Outcome:** _Payment Amount calculation is not essential here. We're looking for using `Factory Method` and the implementation._   

#### **Extra:** _At the end of this exercise, we're looking for pros and cons of using `Factory Method`._  

#### **Output of the program:**
```
Home Loan Payment Amout: 50.5 | Home Loan Payment Frequency: Fortnightly
Personal Loan Payment Amout: 100.1 | Personal Loan Payment Frequency: Monthly
```
